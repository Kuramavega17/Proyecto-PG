# Proyecto-PG- Stronghold for Minecraf



## ðŸš€ Description
In the current era of technology, graphics programming has emerged as a powerful tool for creating immersive and educational experiences. This project focuses on creating a maze inspired by Minecraft's Stronghold, using Python in conjunction with OpenGL. Minecraft is known for its vast world of building and adventuring, and Strongholds are iconic structures that host challenges.
The goal of this project is to develop a maze experience that allows users to explore a detailed recreation of a Stronghold, with the ability to interact with the environment intuitively. To achieve this, we will use advanced graphics programming, 3D modeling and rendering techniques, leveraging the capabilities of OpenGL and the flexibility of Python.
The maze not only seeks to replicate the appearance and structure of a Stronghold, but also to capture the atmosphere and sense of adventure that characterizes these buildings in Minecraft. Users will be able to walk through corridors, observe architectural details and manage to cross our small maze to the main room. This project is not only a demonstration of technical skills, but also a way to pay tribute to one of the most influential games of the last decade.





## How to execute the project?

To run this project is necessary to have Visual Studio Code and also install Python, after having this installed we have to download the files that are in this repository and open it from Visual Studio Code.
We will be leaving the download links of Visual Studio Code and Python.

Here is a link to a Youtube video where you can see the execution of our project and how to check if everything is installed correctly: https://youtu.be/czfbcCr1A0k
## How to contribute to the project?

To begin with, this project meets all the functional standards that should have a maze but still has several points of improvement such as textures, interactivity with the user, you can also make a start menu and you can also work with more sounds for each situation within the maze.
